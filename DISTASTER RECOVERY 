Route 53, ELB, autoscaling, EC2 instances , cloud watch , RDS, Elastic search, SNS


DR
1. Backup and restore

WEB >> APACHE<NGINX
APP > WEBLOGICS
DB

DR

 >> DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY

THIS WILL TAKE TIME  RTO > RECOVERY TIME OBJECTIVE  (( HOW SOON CAN YOU RESTORE THE SYSTEM))
eg> apache goes down today around 11:30am and backup runs at 12am, the difference btw both willl be11 hrs

IT MIGHT TAKE 3 hours to restore the servers, install new servers, DB etc

RPO >> RECOVERY POINT OBJECTIVE

2. Pilot Light

Traffics is coming from route 53 to this 
WEB >> APACHE<NGINX
APP > WEBLOGICS
DB

But you will have the same replicas but in shutdown mode, just need to reconfigure with the latest update and sync up the environment, maybe once in a day or weekly, based on the RTO and RPO based on cost

WEB >> APACHE<NGINX
APP > WEBLOGICS
DB

3. Warm standby ( we can bare some money but can’t handle downtime for the site)
 DC SITE
WEB >> APACHE<NGINX - 8 CPU and 16 GB ram
APP > WEBLOGICS > 16/32
DB
DR SITE
WEB >> APACHE<NGINX - 1CPU and 8 GB ram
APP > WEBLOGICS > 1/2
DB

Like this is giving only to keep the application up and running, just to make sure that everything is in sync. And the sync will be done automatically,  maybe we can use rsync  or scp commands to update your servers.

If your main sites goes down we can use the route 53 to route the traffics from DC SITE to DR SITE, and its done automatically, cuz ROUTE53 works as load balancer type. 

And autoscaling will launch new instances based on the usage.

4. MUTLISITE

DC-CENTRAL SITE
WEB >> APACHE<NGINX - 8 CPU and 16 GB ram
APP > WEBLOGICS > 16/32
DB

DC-EAST-SITE
WEB >> APACHE<NGINX - 8 CPU and 16 GB ram
APP > WEBLOGICS > 16/32
DB

Its like you can serve the traffics 50/50 from each sites, 
Active/active
Active/passive
